use a # and then type your comment behind it



2.) Enter a=2 and b=5 in the Python Console window and then all of the following. 
What are the outputs?

b/a                 = 2.5
b//a                = 2
b**a                = 25
b%a                 = 1
a+B                 = 7
type(42)            = <class 'int'>
type(42.0)          = <class 'float'>
type("C3PO")        = <class 'str'>
type(True)          = <class 'bool'>



3.) What is the final output of (a) and type(a) if you enter the following 5 lines
into the Python Console Window?

a=2   2
a*=10     20
a/=2      10.0
a+=12     22.0
a-=7      15.0

a             = 15.00
type(a)       =



4.) Fix the mistake in the following code.
x,y = (4,5)
a = 3*(x + y)
a






5.) Fix the code so it will calculate the average.
x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = x+y+z/3
ave
